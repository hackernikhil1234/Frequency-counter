1Ô∏è‚É£ Build a Frequency Map
Use an unordered_map in C++ to count how many times each number appears.

For every number in the array, increase its count in the map.

Example:
If nums = [1][1]
The frequency map will be:

text
1 ‚Üí 2 times  
2 ‚Üí 2 times  
3 ‚Üí 1 time  
4 ‚Üí 1 time
2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Maximum Frequency
Look for the highest frequency value in the map.

In the example above, both 1 and 2 appear 2 times (which is the maximum).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sum the Occurrences of All Elements With Maximum Frequency
For every entry in the map:

If its frequency is greater than the current max, update the max and reset the sum.

If its frequency is equal to the max, add that frequency to the sum.

This way, you count all appearances of the most frequent elements.

üí° Example Walkthrough
Example 1
Input:
nums = [1][1]

Step 1: Frequency Map

text
1: 2Ô∏è‚É£  
2: 2Ô∏è‚É£  
3: 1Ô∏è‚É£  
4: 1Ô∏è‚É£
Step 2: Maximum Frequency
Max frequency = 2

Step 3: Sum Occurrences
Elements with max frequency: 1 and 2
Total occurrences: 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) = 4

Output:
4

Example 2
Input:
nums = [1]

Step 1: Frequency Map

text
1: 1Ô∏è‚É£  
2: 1Ô∏è‚É£  
3: 1Ô∏è‚É£  
4: 1Ô∏è‚É£  
5: 1Ô∏è‚É£
Step 2: Maximum Frequency
Max frequency = 1

Step 3: Sum Occurrences
All elements have frequency 1
Total occurrences: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5

Output:
5

üßë‚Äçüíª C++ Code Logic (Line by Line)
cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        // 1. Create a map to count frequency of each number
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        // 2. Find the maximum frequency and sum occurrences
        int maxFreq = 0, sum = 0;
        for (auto& entry : freq) {
            if (entry.second > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = entry.second; // New max found
                sum = maxFreq;          // Start new sum
            } else if (entry.second == maxFreq) {
                sum += maxFreq;         // Add to sum if same as max
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
üéØ Key Points
unordered_map is used to count frequencies efficiently.

Track the maximum frequency and the total occurrences of all elements with that frequency.

The answer is the sum of all counts for the most frequent elements.

üöÄ Why Is This Useful?
This approach is fast (linear time) and works for any size of input.

It‚Äôs a common pattern for many interview and coding contest problems involving counting and grouping.
