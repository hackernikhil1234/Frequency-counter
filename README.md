üìù Problem: Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
Given:
An array nums of positive integers.

Goal:
Find the total number of occurrences of the elements that appear the most times in the array.

Frequency:
The frequency of an element is how many times it appears in the array.

üîç Step-by-Step Solution Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Build a Frequency Map
We use a HashMap to count how many times each number appears.

For every number in the array, we increase its count in the map.

Example:
If nums = [1][1]
The frequency map will be:

text
1 ‚Üí 2 times  
2 ‚Üí 2 times  
3 ‚Üí 1 time  
4 ‚Üí 1 time
2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Maximum Frequency
We look for the highest frequency value in the map.

In the example above, both 1 and 2 appear 2 times (which is the maximum).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sum the Occurrences of All Elements With Maximum Frequency
For every entry in the map:

If its frequency is greater than the current max, update the max and reset the sum.

If its frequency is equal to the max, add that frequency to the sum.

This way, we count all appearances of the most frequent elements.

üí° Example Walkthrough
Example 1
Input:
nums = [1][1]

Step 1: Frequency Map

1: 2Ô∏è‚É£

2: 2Ô∏è‚É£

3: 1Ô∏è‚É£

4: 1Ô∏è‚É£

Step 2: Maximum Frequency

Max frequency = 2

Step 3: Sum Occurrences

Elements with max frequency: 1 and 2

Total occurrences: 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) = 4

Output:
4

Example 2
Input:
nums = [1]

Step 1: Frequency Map

1: 1Ô∏è‚É£

2: 1Ô∏è‚É£

3: 1Ô∏è‚É£

4: 1Ô∏è‚É£

5: 1Ô∏è‚É£

Step 2: Maximum Frequency

Max frequency = 1

Step 3: Sum Occurrences

All elements have frequency 1

Total occurrences: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5

Output:
5

üßë‚Äçüíª Java Code Logic (Line by Line)
java
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequencyElements(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Create a map to count frequency of each number
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            freq.put(i, freq.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }

        // 2. Find the maximum frequency and sum occurrences
        int max = 0, sum = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : freq.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > max) {
                max = entry.getValue(); // New max found
                sum = max;              // Start new sum
            } else if (entry.getValue() == max) {
                sum += max;             // Add to sum if same as max
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
üéØ Key Points
HashMap is used to count frequencies efficiently.

We track the maximum frequency and the total occurrences of all elements with that frequency.

The answer is the sum of all counts for the most frequent elements.

üöÄ Why Is This Useful?
This approach is fast (linear time) and works for any size of input.
